# Rokos2021
This contains code for Rokos 2021 Internship with Oxford Robotics Institute

Date started: 28 June 2021
- **Wk1:** Initial setup & Bayesian/Frequentist Gaussian models
- **Wk2:** Multiparameter Bayesian Optimisation (Gaussian) & Goodness-of-fit (GOF) for 88 Scipy distributions (Walmart)
- **Wk3:** Select & Implement best 3 distributions (Lognorm, Invgauss, Invgamma)
- **Wk4:** Select Lognorm distribution (for Walmart map) & KS tests between all edges to check what factors affect similarity
- **Wk5:** Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) according to Kolmogorov-Smirov (KS) score and spatial factors (for Walmart & Blenheim maps)
- **Wk6:** Methods for generalisation between edges in same cluster. Linear regression (params vs spatial features)
- **Wk7:** GOF for 88 Scipy distributions (AAF). HAC clustering (AAF). Binary Classification of edge similarity based on spatial features
