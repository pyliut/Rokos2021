# Week 10, started 31 Aug 2021
My plan for this week is to focus on the evaluation pipeline & also spend some time on the documentation of writeups/code
* **[TUE] – Evaluation Part 1:** create framework to compare MLE & Bayesian method (naïve prior) as data points are fed into the system. Create some helper docs/readmes that make github/writeups more user-friendly
* **[WED] – Evaluation Part 2:** Add random picking & picking according to closest edge length
* **[THU] – Evaluation Part 3:** Add binary classifier to pick according to edges with the highest probability of similarity (i.e. probability of class 0)
* **[FRI] – Evaluation Part 4:** Add KS regressor to pick according to edges with lowest predicted KS
