# Week 9, starting 23 Aug 2021

* [MON] – Finish pipeline: Turn binary classification into clusters 
* [TUE] – Test performance by looking at sum/mean of KS distances using our generalisation methods. Compare to edge length clustering & KS clustering
* [WED] – Try to improve performance of clustering and classifier algorithms
* [THU] – Test binary classifier on Walmart vs Blenheim & Walmart vs AAF/TSC. Does this work?
* [FRI] – Can you perform clustering or classification between maps (e.g. AAF & TSC) and directly transfer the data?
* [EXTRA] – Plan alternative environments
