# Week 3, starting 12 July 2021

# Mon: DISTRIBUTIONS.ipynb. Use KS/MAE Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) tests on all distributions in Scipy to see which distributions fit the data well
# Tues: Weekly meeting. Write up findings/reasoning so far. Filter out multi-robot data. 
# Wed: Repeat DISTRIBUTIONS.ipynb with filtered data and on multiple edges
# Thu: When are certain GOF measure most suitable? Investigate distributions with best GOF - do they have conjugate priors / can we optimise over all variables?
# Fri: Implement Bayesian updates for chosen distribution. Allow for online updates. Use prob. forecasting on test data for thresholding (i.e. when do you stop Bayesian updates).

#Further tasks: Generalise between edges in the same dataset
