Week started 9 Aug 2021

Plan for this week:
* [MON] - Fix issues from last week (check congestion algorithm against scalar context, randomise datapoints for mergefit, answer questions about CRPS/KS/CVM, fix my implementation of CVM test)
* [TUE] - Fit distributions for STRANDS datasets
* [WED] - Cluster edges according to KS, CVM, edge length, connections, max angle of turning etc.
* [THU] - Classification based on factors (edge length, connections, etc). Output is binary: do 2 edges belong to the same cluster?
* [FRI] - Test classification on the other map against a "ground truth" determined by KS/CVM clustering

Work for TUE-FRI in this folder. Work for MON in Wk7 folder
