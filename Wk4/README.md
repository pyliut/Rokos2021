Week 4, starting on 19 July 2021

# Schedule
* Mon: Congestion data repo. Additional filtering: did the robot start at origin node?
* Tue: Invgamma & Invgauss distributions
* Wed: Hard cutoff in distributions. Use probabilistic forecasting for thresholding
* Thu: KS test between different edges. Where are the opportunities for generalisation?
* Fri: Try to generalise between 2 edges that are similar according to 2-sample KS test
* Weekend: Prepare PPT for reading group update

# Further tasks
* Network visualisation
* Generalise between edges
* Does the generalisation hold if you increase the congestion?
