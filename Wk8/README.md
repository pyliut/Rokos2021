* [TUE] - Fix congestion (blenheim), analyse unexpected clustering (AAF), different no. of KS clusters forbinary classification
* [WED] - Use data from other years (AAF). Check classifier performance on TSC
* [THU] - Train classifier on AAF, test on TSC, and vice versa
* [FRI] - Use binary classifier to generate clusters. Visualise in network map & compare to KS clusters

Work from [MON] is in Wk7_STRANDS. Some work from [TUE] is in this folder. Remaining work in Wk8_STRANDS.
